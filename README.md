```

- MacOS:

```

- Windows:
```cmd
> safe-pass completion powershell > safe-pass.ps1
```

## Usage

The safe-pass is a command line utility for managing sensitive data such as passwords, keys and tokens. It uses a redis database for storing the data, and provides a simple and secure way to interact with the data.

The tool is designed to be used from the command line, and provides a number of commands to add, list, retrieve and delete data from the database.


The available commands are:

- `add`: Add a password, key or token to the database.
- `show`: Show all data or data by category, domain and tag.
- `delete`: Delete a password, key or token from the database.
- `passgen`: Password Generator for making the user's life easier by simply hitting the generation, specifing some flags like:
    - `-l --length`: Determine the length of the password
    - `-s --special-characters`: Determine wether the password contains special characters or not
    - `-n --numbers`: Determine wether the password contains numbers or not

## TO-DO

- [x] Encrypt passwords using `crypto/aes` lib
- [-] Master Password: Making a local authentication for the user to ensure security of the password saved from frauds
- [ ] Setup: Making a user-friendly setup, ensuring user have the required dependancies (`redis` for data storage), and setting the Master Password for accessing the data securly.
- [x] Add data: Adding password or key to the database, including the domain and tag to remeber the usecase of data stored.
- [x] Retrive data: returning the password of the requested domain.
- [-] Export Data: the user could export all data found in the database in an easy formatted form (such as `JSON` or `TXT`)
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility: Making the tool opperating for both `windows` and `linux`. Starting with linux tho.
